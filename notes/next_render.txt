if the file to be texted is a React component, and has:

import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"
...
const router = useRouter();

add the following code to the top of the test file, after the imports:

// Mock useRouter:
jest.mock("next/navigation", () => ({

      prefetch: () => null
    };
  }
}));
